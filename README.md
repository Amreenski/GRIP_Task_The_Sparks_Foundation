Task 1 of GRIP internship task under the sparks foundation that involved prediction of percentage of student based on the number of study hours using linear regression📊📈💻💯

What i did ?
1️⃣ Imported the necessary libraries
2️⃣ Loaded the dataset containing the student's study hours and corresponding percentage scores into a Pandas dataframe.
3️⃣ Explored the dataset by checking the number of rows and columns, checking for missing values, and visualizing the data using scatter plots or other appropriate plots.
4️⃣ Splited the data into the input features (study hours) and the target variable (percentage scores).
5️⃣ Splited the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() function from sklearn. Typically, a 70-30 or 80-20 split is used. I used 80-20.
6️⃣ Created an instance of the LinearRegression model from sklearn.
7️⃣ Fitted the training data to the linear regression model using the fit() function.
8️⃣ Visualized the Regression Line.
9️⃣ Used the model to predict the percentage scores on the testing set using the predict() function.
🔟 Compared the predicted values with the actual percentage scores from the testing set.
✅ Evaluated the model's performance by calculating metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).
🎯 Finally, used the trained model to predict the percentage score for a given number of study hours.
